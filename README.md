<h1>The Odin Project</h1>

<p>HTML practice! I'm going through the Odin Project to reinforce what I learned in SCF's software bootcamp. I practice the Seasame Street methods of learning, which means repitition! This section is covering HTML and soon CSS. I know in coding, you're never actually comfortable because there's always so many things to be learning, but I want to reinforce my base before building a possible house of cards.</p>
